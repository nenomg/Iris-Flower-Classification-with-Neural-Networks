# Iris-Flower-Classification-with-Neural-Networks
This GitHub repository contains Python code for a simple neural network model that classifies Iris flowers into three species (setosa, versicolor, and virginica). The code leverages popular libraries such as Pandas, TensorFlow, and Matplotlib for data handling, model creation, and visualization.
